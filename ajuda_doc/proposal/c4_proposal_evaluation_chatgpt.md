Based on a full review of your PhD proposal, here is a **committee-style grade assessment** followed by a **SWOT analysis**.

## ðŸŽ“ **Committee Evaluation and Grade**

### Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion                           | Evaluation                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clarity of Research Objectives**  | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Clear, focused, and well-aligned with broader sustainability goals.                             |
| **Significance and Originality**    | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Highly original comparative approach with strong theoretical backing.                           |
| **Methodological Rigor**            | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† Technically advanced and feasible, though dependent on data availability and engagement levels. |
| **Feasibility within Timeline**     | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† Ambitious but well-structured timeline; risks exist in engagement or technical execution.       |
| **Engagement & Ethical Practice**   | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Best-practice application of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and ethics.                            |
| **Scholarly Foundations**           | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… Strong integration with comprehensive exams; clear academic lineage.                            |
| **Impact & Knowledge Mobilization** | â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜† Very strong, especially through open-source tools; some risks in overpromising reach.           |

### Final Committee Grade: **A / A+ (94%)**

This is a strong, well-written, and socially responsible proposal with academic, technical, and policy relevance. The only caveats are related to the heavy reliance on stakeholder engagement and technical infrastructureâ€”which, while feasible, will require careful management.

## SWOT Analysis

| **Strengths**                                                                       | **Weaknesses**                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Strong interdisciplinarity (policy + geospatial science + Indigenous governance). | - Complexity of tool development and computational workflows could lead to delays or tech debt.         |
| - Grounded in three rigorous comprehensive exam papers.                             | - Case study success is partially contingent on levels of community engagement, which may vary.         |
| - Clearly defined methodology with a tested, validated prototype.                   | - Potential overreliance on MapBiomas/Hansen datasets that may carry classification bias.               |
| - Prioritizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty and community-led validation.             | - Ethical and technical obligations can delay publication/dissemination if partner feedback is delayed. |
| - Highly replicable, open-source and cost-effective.                                | - High expectations for multi-stakeholder impact may face institutional resistance or policy inertia.   |

| **Opportunities**                                                                                       | **Threats**                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Contributes to Canadian and Brazilian forest policy debates amid UNDRIP/Marco Temporal legal shifts.  | - Political developments (e.g., rollbacks on Indigenous rights in either country) may limit uptake. |
| - Can support community-led monitoring, empowering Indigenous stewardship.                              | - Risk of disengagement or refusal by key communities due to extractive research fatigue.           |
| - Potential to produce high-impact publications and international presentations.                        | - Technical limitations (resolution, accuracy) may be challenged by reviewers or partners.          |
| - Methodological frameworks may be adopted by NGOs or international policy bodies (e.g., FAO, UN-REDD). | - Territorial legal disputes could constrain the ability to publish findings or maps.               |

Would you like feedback tailored for submission to ethics boards, funding agencies, or potential Indigenous collaborators? I can also help you craft a short abstract or policy brief from this proposal.
