# Methodology {#methodology}

## 1\. Policy Analysis (1980-Present) {#1.-policy-analysis-(1980-present)}

This phase aims to comprehensively understand the evolution, content, and intended outcomes of Brazil and British Columbia forest/land/indigenous policies. The analysis will cover national, regional, and local policies, recognizing the multi-layered governance structures in both countries.

This Policy Analysis phase will provide a solid foundation for understanding the policy context and identifying potential linkages between policies and observed land use changes in the subsequent phases of the research project.

#### 

#### **1.1 Policy Identification and Compilation** {#1.1-policy-identification-and-compilation}

# 

The planned activities start by effectively analyzing forestry and environmental policies to create a detailed inventory of documents. This inventory will focus on forests, land use, and Indigenous peoples' rights in Brazil and British Columbia and cover the period from 1980 to the present. 

We will examine the changes that have shaped policies related to forestry, the environment, and land use and explore how the drivers of forest gain and loss have evolved. This exploration includes the impact of early human occupation, and the formal policies introduced during colonization.

Our data will come from various sources, including government websites, official publications, academic literature, legal databases, policy reviews, and reports from international organizations.

We will organize and categorize the policies based on their geographic scope. This area includes national, provincial (for British Columbia), and state levels in Brazil's Amazon and Atlantic Forests. Additionally, we will group them thematically. Our focus areas will include forest conservation, land use planning, Indigenous land rights, environmental protection, and economic development related to forestry.

Finally, we will classify the policies by their instruments. The main types are regulations, incentives, market-based mechanisms, voluntary agreements, and community-based initiatives.

#### 

#### **1.2 Policy Content Analysis** {#1.2-policy-content-analysis}

# 

The next step involves analyzing the content of the identified policies to support the policy analysis framework. The goal is to extract key information regarding several critical aspects.

First, we need to identify each policy explicitly stated aims and intended outcomes. Next, we should determine the target stakeholders that the policy seeks to influence or benefit.

Understanding the mechanisms used to achieve the policy objectives is also important. Additionally, we must know which agencies are responsible for implementation and enforcement. This includes understanding the monitoring and evaluation procedures in place and any penalties for non-compliance.

We will employ qualitative content analysis techniques to analyze these policy elements systematically. This analysis will allow us to code and categorize the information effectively.

Once we have extracted the relevant data, we can develop a data frame or spreadsheet. The structured database will help us organize and synthesize the information, ensuring it is easily accessible for comparison across different policies.

#### 

#### **1.3 Historical Context and Policy Evolution** {#1.3-historical-context-and-policy-evolution}

 We are considering a land cover change evaluation with satellite-derived data, available only from the 1980s. We expect to notice the actual change detection in the 80s-90s, making it reasonable to look at legislation swifts in the last 5 decades. That period makes tracing the historical context and evolution of policies in Brazil and British Columbia since the 1970s essential for adequate policy analysis. This phase involves several key steps:

1\. Identifying Major Policy Shifts: Examine the significant changes, drivers of change, and the influence of international agreements and global trends.

2\. Considering Historical Context: Analyze the impacts of colonization on land tenure systems and Indigenous rights in Brazil and British Columbia.

3\. Analyzing Policy Evolution: Understand how policies were developed over time in response to changing societal values and priorities.

4\. Understanding Scientific Developments: Incorporate the emerging scientific understanding of forest ecosystems and their land use impacts.

5\. Evaluating Economic Pressures: Consider the effects of market forces and economic pressures on policy decisions.

6\. Acknowledging International Commitments: Review the influence of international commitments and environmental agreements on policymaking.

This historical analysis is vital for comprehending the origins and objectives of current policies and anticipating the impacts of potential changes. Humans occupied the Americas for 15,000 years before formal policies and colonization impacted forest gain and loss. By examining the historical evolution of forestry policies, we can better understand how past decisions have shaped the present.

Policies related to forest management have evolved in response to changing social values, a growing emphasis on sustainability, learning from past policies, technological advancements, and shifts in governance. British Columbia's focus has transitioned from revenue generation to conservation and sustainable forest management. Conversely, Brazil's early forest policy relied heavily on fiscal incentives and monoculture plantations.

Additionally, it is crucial to consider the effects of colonialism on recent Indigenous land tenure rulings. Colonialism disrupted Indigenous land tenure systems globally; the lasting effects of these colonial legacies and the differences between standard and civil law traditions continue to influence customary land rights and formal legal systems. Historical injustices persist and shape contemporary land disputes. Addressing the lasting effects involves recognizing Indigenous titles and acknowledging Indigenous legal systems.

Integrating this historical context into the policy analysis allows a deeper understanding of the factors driving policy change and identifies the key actors involved.

#### 1.4 Policy Gaps and Coherence Analysis {#1.4-policy-gaps-and-coherence-analysis}

Conducting a policy gap and coherence analysis is essential to improving the policy analysis framework. This analysis will help identify shortcomings and inconsistencies that hinder effective forest conservation and the protection of Indigenous land.

A comprehensive evaluation assesses how well various policies align and support each other across different sectors and levels of government. Additionally, it is important to consider the unintended consequences of policy interactions and any implementation challenges that may arise.

Key areas that require special attention include:

* Market Failures and Externalities.  
* Economic Development vs. Environmental Protection.  
* Indigenous Property Rights and Tenure Arrangements.

Often, a lack of coherence between policy regimes and between policy regimes indicates the presence of one or more policy gaps. Evaluating current policies is crucial to achieving effective land use and policy integration. This evaluation should lead to the adoption of coordinated policy mixes that span across sectors and governance levels.

Policy coherence is vital for effective land management. It helps reduce conflicts and promote synergies within and between different policy areas. When sectoral ministries maintain control without coordination, it can weaken overall policy integration.

Addressing these critical areas can promote sustainable forest management and protect Indigenous land rights, strengthening the policy analysis framework.

#### 1.5 Stakeholder Analysis {#1.5-stakeholder-analysis}

To advance in the policy analysis framework, analyzing relevant actors is important. This phase involves identifying key forest and land management stakeholders within the selected case study areas. The main interest groups include:

* Government agencies  
* Indigenous and local communities  
* The forestry industry and private landowners  
* Environmental organizations and conservation groups

The relevant actor's analysis should focus on several aspects:

1\. Stakeholder Perspectives: Analyze the stakeholders' views on existing policies.  
2\. Influence on Policy Development: Examine how these stakeholders influence the creation and revision of policies.  
3\. Potential Conflicts or Alliances: Identify potential conflicts or alliances among stakeholders.

This analysis can involve reviewing various sources, such as:

\- Stakeholder submissions during policy consultations  
\- Media and organizational reports  
\- Academic literature

Understanding the behavioral aspects of stakeholders is crucial for grasping the dynamics of policy development and effectiveness. Additionally, we should consider societal relationships and the rationalities that impact forest management decisions.

Stakeholder involvement is essential for both policy development and implementation. Inclusive policy processes play a vital role in achieving effective outcomes. Furthermore, it is important to understand forest owners' motivations and decision-making processes. The success of policies relies heavily on implementation and compliance mechanisms.

## 

## 2\. Land Use Change Analysis (1980-Present) {#2.-land-use-change-analysis-(1980-present)}

This phase aims to quantify and analyze the patterns of land use change within and surrounding the selected indigenous lands in Brazil and British Columbia. The analysis will utilize remote sensing data, primarily Hansen's Global Forest Change dataset, to detect changes in forest cover over time. It will also incorporate other spatial data sources and ground-truthing efforts, as available, to refine the analysis and ensure data accuracy.

This Land Use Change Analysis will provide a robust and spatially explicit understanding of the changes occurring within and around the indigenous lands. By integrating various data sources and employing diverse analytical techniques, the research will generate valuable insights into the complex dynamics of land use change in policy contexts and indigenous land management practices.

#### **2.1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing** {#2.1.-data-acquisition-and-preprocessing}

The next step focuses on data acquisition and preprocessing to enhance the policy analysis framework and involves several key actions.

First, acquire Hansen's Global Forest Change dataset. Download the relevant data for the selected study areas from the freely available online platform. This dataset provides information on forest extent, loss, and gain at a 30-meter resolution from 2000 to the present.

Next, gather additional data for historical context from 1980 to 2000\. Explore alternative datasets, such as Landsat archives, to extend the analysis back to 1980\. Identify and download individual Landsat scenes or preprocessed composites for interest areas. We intend to run all processes locally with open data and software. Cloud-based platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) and NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) can help efficiently access and process large volumes of data.

After obtaining the data, preprocess it to ensure accuracy. This step may include a geometric correction to maintain proper spatial alignment across datasets. Atmospheric correction is also crucial to reduce atmospheric interference in satellite imagery. Implement cloud masking techniques to remove cloud cover or identify cloud-related artifacts in classification data, yielding apparent features description of the land surface.

Once preprocessing is complete, create complimentary land cover classifications if needed. Use the raw Landsat data to apply classification algorithms that categorize land cover types based on their spectral information. Employ established land use classification systems, such as those from the IPCC or national standards, to maintain consistency and comparability throughout the analysis. Choose suitable classification algorithms based on data characteristics and research objectives. Adequate training data may warrant decision trees or random forest classifiers, while clustering algorithms can be helpful in exploratory analysis. This step will only occur if the readily available land cover data is insufficient, or we identify problems over interest areas.

We can study events from 1985 onward, as Landsat satellite data has been publicly accessible. Landsat data is valuable due to its 30-meter spatial resolution and long history as a satellite data source. These characteristics make it suitable for detailed land cover and land use change analysis.

#### **2.2 Time-Series Analysis of Forest Cover Change** {#2.2-time-series-analysis-of-forest-cover-change}

Analyzing time-series data is essential for identifying significant changes in forest cover. This analysis can highlight notable loss or gain periods, often linked to Hansen's changes or other influencing factors. Methods like LandTrendr and spectral trajectory analysis provide deeper insights into forest disturbance and recovery. These techniques help us understand the resilience of forests within and outside protected areas, typically through pixel-by-pixel evaluations of change.

Remote sensing technologies, particularly the Landsat program, are vital in monitoring and analyzing land use changes. Time-series analysis of Landsat data is particularly effective for characterizing forest disturbances and recovery. The choice of algorithms for analyzing land cover change should be based on the specific application and the data type available.

Landsat data is invaluable for tracking changes in land cover due to its long historical record, global coverage, medium resolution, and free access since 2008\. A range of change detection methods can effectively assess these transformations, from simple two-point comparisons to complex time-series analyses.

Lastly, understanding historical patterns is crucial for interpreting current land use dynamics. Past policies and economic activities have shaped today's landscapes, making historical context a key factor in analysis and future management strategies.

In general, we will quantify deforestation and regeneration rates by calculating annual or multi-year deforestation rates within and surrounding each Indigenous land with these steps:

1. Calculate annual or multi-year deforestation and forest recovery rates within and surrounding each Indigenous land.  
2. Analyze the change in forest area from year to year.  
3. Calculate the proportion of forest lost about the initial forest area.  
4. Examine the time-series data for notable shifts in forest cover.

This contrast will help identify periods of significant forest loss or gain, which may indicate the impacts of policy changes or other driving factors. We present candidate areas for analysis in both countries in **Appendix A**, in areas we consider having contrast in historical land usage between them or their surroundings.

**Figure 7** \- Brazil Amazon Biome, estimated forest cover in 2000, federal protected conservation in bright green areas and indigenous designated lands with yellow contour.

#### **2.3 Spatial Analysis of Land Use Change Patterns** {#2.3-spatial-analysis-of-land-use-change-patterns}

To refine the policy analysis framework, researchers should conduct a spatial analysis of land use change patterns using GIS software like QGIS. We expect to develop python scripts and database tools to automate the analysis, due to the large amount of data and vast geographical region of interest. This analysis involves several key steps.

First, researchers will create maps to illustrate forest cover changes over time. These visual representations will highlight changes in forest extent within and around Indigenous lands. Identifying deforestation hotspots is crucial, as these areas experience concentrated forest loss. Additionally, mapping land use transitions will provide insight into conversions between different land use types.

Next, researchers will conduct spatial analysis using various methods. They can perform overlay analysis by layering policy boundaries, Indigenous land boundaries, and other relevant spatial data on the land cover change maps. Incorporating roads and protected areas will help visualize the spatial relationships between policies and land use change patterns.

Proximity analysis is another important method. This technique offers insights into deforestation patterns based on distance from roads, settlements, or other features. Understanding accessibility and infrastructure development's influence on forest loss is vital.

Calculating landscape metrics is also essential. This quantification covers forest fragmentation, patch size, and connectivity, providing insights into the impacts of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Furthermore, implementing correlation analysis can explore the relationships between deforestation rates and other spatial variables. These variables may include population density, agricultural land use, and distance to markets, helping identify potential forest loss drivers.

Ground-truthing through field visits should be conducted to verify land cover classifications and validate remote sensing observations. This process involves collecting data on land use practices, assessing forest conditions, recognizing signs of degradation, and gathering local perspectives on land use change.

GIS plays a crucial role in mapping and analyzing spatial data. It enables the visualization and quantification of policy impacts on the landscape. Analyzing changes in landscape metrics within and outside policy-regulated areas can indicate the effectiveness of conservation policies. Various spatial data types are relevant to land cover analysis, including land cover maps, protected area boundaries, and infrastructure data. Socioeconomic and biophysical data can significantly influence land use decisions and policy outcomes.

Lastly, assessing the correlation between forest fire occurrence and land use types is important for evaluating policies to reduce fire risk in human-modified forests. By integrating policy data with spatial analysis and GIS, researchers and policymakers can gain a deeper understanding of policies' impacts on land use. Visualizing and quantifying the spatial dimensions of policy effects enhances comprehension of the complex interactions between policies and their objectives.

**Figure 8 –** Data Processing diagram with the possible logic steps to evaluate land cover/use.  
We present an initial approach to the Mapbiomas Indigenous lands processing in the **Appendix B** with the explanation on coding and programming techniques in **Appendix C**. 

#### **2.4 Data Integration and Synthesis:** {#2.4-data-integration-and-synthesis:}

Integrating data from various sources is essential for understanding land use change dynamics on and around Indigenous lands. By combining insights from remote sensing analysis, GIS spatial analysis, and any ground-truthing conducted, we can better understand these changes.

A key element of this analysis is comparing land use change patterns inside reserves with those outside. We will analyze differences in deforestation rates, forest cover changes, and other relevant indicators between Indigenous lands and their surrounding areas. Such comparisons are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of policies designed to protect Indigenous lands and forests.

Linking land use change patterns to policy analysis is equally important. We need to connect the observed land use changes to the relevant policies. This requires us to examine the temporal correlation between policy changes and shifts in land use patterns and analyze the spatial overlap between policy boundaries and areas of significant forest loss or gain. Additionally, we must consider how policy instruments and enforcement mechanisms influence land use decisions.

Using GIS to integrate policy and spatial data is vital for mapping policy impacts. Effective policies should weave environmental concerns into broader land use planning and decision-making processes. Combining data with policy analysis can inform policy decisions and assess their effectiveness.

We must focus on practical policy integration to minimize trade-offs and enhance synergies. This involves aligning mitigation and adaptation policies for internal coherence while ensuring that climate change considerations are integrated with broader development goals. Vertical integration incorporates climate change into sectoral policies, while horizontal integration promotes cross-sectoral coordination through effective governance structures.

## 3\. Comparative Case Study Analysis {#3.-comparative-case-study-analysis}

This phase involves synthesizing findings from the previous phases (Policy Analysis and Land Use Change Analysis) to draw comparative insights between the case study areas in Brazil and British Columbia. The analysis will focus on understanding the relationships between policy contexts, land use change patterns, and Indigenous land management practices in each case study.  
This Comparative Case Study Analysis phase will be the culminating point of the research project, enabling the development of evidence-based policy recommendations and contributing to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between forest/land/Indigenous policies and land use change on Indigenous lands in Brazil and British Columbia. By comparing the experiences of different case studies, the research will shed light on the factors that influence policy success and provide valuable insights for promoting sustainable land management practices that respect indigenous rights and contribute to global conservation efforts.

#### **3.1 Case Study Selection and Justification:** {#3.1-case-study-selection-and-justification:}

To continue our research and policy analysis on land cover change, we will focus on specific Indigenous lands in Brazil, particularly within the Amazon and Atlantic Forest biomes, as well as in British Columbia (Canada). We will guide our selection by the need to represent different policy contexts. We will choose Indigenous lands that have experienced varying degrees of policy influence and have faced different implementation challenges. **Appendix A** has a starting point on area identification.

For instance, we will select reserves with distinct levels of legal recognition, tenure security, and varying degrees of involvement in forest management decision-making. This diversity will help us comprehensively understand how policies impact land use.

Sufficient remote sensing and spatial data must be available for the selected areas. This data will enable us to conduct robust analyses of land use change. Additionally, we will consider factors such as accessibility, safety, and the potential for collaboration with Indigenous communities to ensure the feasibility of ground-truthing efforts.

**Figure 9 \-** Canada Indigenous lands, variable buffer, and Hansen’s Forest cover 2000, loss until 2023 and gain until 2023\. We will select areas for comparing the buffer and the delimited indigenous region. Darker blue suggests more forest cover in the year 2000 by total area.

**Figure 10** \- Brazil Indigenous lands, variable buffer, and Hansen’s Forest cover 2000, loss until 2023 and gain until 2023\. We will select areas for comparing the buffer and the delimited indigenous region. Darker blue suggests more forest cover in the year 2000 by total area.

Finally, we will provide detailed justification for our case study areas and explain how each area represents different policy contexts and contributes to the comparative analysis. The Comparative Case Study Analysis will serve as the project's culmination. It will allow us to develop evidence-based policy recommendations and deepen our understanding of the complex relationships between forest, land, and Indigenous policies and land use change on Indigenous lands and nearby regions in Brazil and British Columbia.

#### **3.2 In-Depth Analysis of Each Case Study:** {#3.2-in-depth-analysis-of-each-case-study:}

Examining selected Indigenous lands is essential to advance the research proposal on land cover change and policy analysis. This process involves several key components:

The analysis begins with the Policy Analysis Phase, where relevant policies impacting Indigenous lands are summarized. This involves identifying the goals of these policies, the target stakeholders involved, and the mechanisms for their implementation. Additionally, highlight any potential gaps or inconsistencies within these policies.

Next is the Land Use Change Analysis Phase, which presents quantified land use change patterns. This includes deforestation rates and forest disturbance dynamics, examining recovery patterns within the forests, and discussing the spatial analysis results.

Following that, the focus shifts to the Linkages Between Policies and Land Use Changes. This involves analyzing connections between policy developments and observed land use changes, investigating temporal correlations between policy changes and shifts in land use patterns, and assessing the spatial overlap between policy boundaries and areas of significant forest loss or gain.

The Influence of Policy Instruments section evaluates how various policy instruments and enforcement mechanisms affect land use decisions on Indigenous lands and surrounding areas. This analysis also considers the perspectives of different stakeholders.

The analysis further explores Unintended Consequences that may arise from policies or interactions between different policy instruments.

A Comparative Analysis is conducted by performing similar analyses in the surrounding areas, using a buffer proportional to the size of the Indigenous lands. This allows for comparing findings from within the Indigenous lands to those from neighboring areas.

Finally, the study incorporates Data Triangulation by combining insights from policy documents, remote sensing data, GIS spatial analysis, and any ground-truthing conducted. This approach aims to develop a nuanced understanding of the interactions between policies and land use change in each case study.

By conducting this comprehensive assessment, we can better understand the impacts and effectiveness of policies on land cover change. This understanding will consider both environmental and socio-economic impacts. Advanced data methods such as remote sensing, GIS, and spatial analysis techniques will be crucial in integrating policy and spatial data.

#### **3.3 Cross-Case Comparison and Synthesis:** {#3.3-cross-case-comparison-and-synthesis:}

To proceed with the land cover change and policy analysis research proposal, we must develop a comprehensive framework for comparing the case studies. This framework will focus on key variables or dimensions essential for comparison. These variables include policy goals and instruments, implementation and enforcement mechanisms, stakeholder engagement and influence, deforestation rates, land use change patterns, Indigenous land management practices, and social, economic, and environmental outcomes.

Once the framework is established, we will systematically compare the case studies. This process will involve identifying the similarities and differences in various aspects, such as commonalities and divergences in policy contexts, variations in land use change patterns, and different approaches to Indigenous land management.

As part of this analysis, we will examine the factors that contribute to the observed differences. We will explore the reasons behind variations in policy effectiveness, deforestation rates, and land use change outcomes. We will consider several influences, including historical context, governance structures, stakeholder power dynamics, economic pressures, and cultural factors.

Finally, we will draw comparative insights from our analysis. We aim to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between policies, land use change, and Indigenous land management practices, specifically focusing on the experiences of different Indigenous lands in Brazil and British Columbia.

The culmination of this task will be the Comparative Case Study Analysis. Through this analysis, we aim to develop evidence-based policy recommendations and contribute to a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationships between forest policies, land use changes, and Indigenous practices on their lands in Brazil and British Columbia.

#### **3.4 Policy Recommendations and Implications:** {#3.4-policy-recommendations-and-implications:}

We will develop policy recommendations and implications based on a comparative case study analysis to finalize the research proposal on land cover change and policy analysis.

First, we will identify best practices and lessons learned from the case studies. From this analysis, we will formulate strategies to improve policy effectiveness in protecting Indigenous lands and forests. This exercise suggests ways to enhance policy coherence, implementation, and enforcement.

Additionally, we will recommend approaches to strengthen Indigenous participation in forest management decision-making. It will be important to consider the potential for adapting successful policies or practices from one context to another.

We will also discuss the broader implications for sustainable forest management, climate change mitigation, and recognizing Indigenous rights within the global context.

The Comparative Case Study Analysis will serve as the project's culminating point. This will enable us to develop evidence-based policy recommendations and contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between forest, land, and Indigenous policies and land use change on Indigenous lands in Brazil and British Columbia.

By comparing the experiences of different case studies, we aim to illuminate the factors that influence policy success. This approach will provide valuable insights for promoting sustainable land management practices that respect Indigenous rights and contribute to global conservation efforts.

# Expected Outcomes {#expected-outcomes}

The research project will culminate in a comparative case study analysis. This analysis will combine findings from studies on policy and land use change in specific areas of Brazil and British Columbia.

By carrying out this comparative analysis, we aim to create evidence-based policy recommendations. This approach will also enhance our understanding of how forests, land management, Indigenous policies, and land use change interact on Indigenous lands.

By examining the experiences from different case studies, we can identify key factors that contribute to policy success. Furthermore, this analysis will offer insights into promoting sustainable land management practices that respect Indigenous rights while supporting global conservation efforts.

The outcomes of this project will include:  
1\. Peer-Reviewed Publications: Articles published in relevant academic journals that advance the scientific understanding of policy effectiveness in forest conservation and land management.  
2\. Publicly Accessible Maps and Infographics: Detailed land use change maps and visually engaging infographics designed for public dissemination.  
3\. Conference Presentations: Engaging presentations at academic conferences and workshops to share research findings with a wider audience.  
4\. Organized Policy Recommendations: Comprehensive recommendations for land management practices and the protection of indigenous lands in both countries.

## Appendix A {#appendix-a}

The following images are possible case studies. These are example regions for land cover change analysis in Canada and Brazil. These areas have contrast in forest coverage inside and outside the limits of indigenous lands and could relate to public policy changes in the proposed period.

## Appendix B {#appendix-b}

The following content exemplifies the land use change analysis using readily available land change data from Mapbiomas collection 9 in some indigenous reserves selected in Brazilian areas from Appendix A. We present the computational explanation for creating these examples in the Appendix C. This project aims to evaluate those against policy changes in the same period. These are preliminary results used to validate the performance and validity of the data we expect will be sufficient to analyze land cover change and policy influences.

## Appendix C {#appendix-c}

#### C.1 Computational Framework for Indigenous Territory Land Cover Analysis {#c.1-computational-framework-for-indigenous-territory-land-cover-analysis}

This appendix provides detailed documentation of the preliminary computational framework developed to analyze historical land cover change within indigenous territories in Brazil from 1985 to 2023\. This is a simple 1205 lines python script. The analysis leverages MapBiomas Collection 8 data to quantify land cover transitions, persistence patterns, and change dynamics that support the policy analysis presented in this PhD project proposal.

[https://github.com/leandromet/nlp\_project\_cuda/blob/main/raster\_proc/brazil\_self\_color\_table\_polygon.py](https://github.com/leandromet/nlp_project_cuda/blob/main/raster_proc/brazil_self_color_table_polygon.py) \- MIT license, developer Leandro Meneguelli Biondo 2025\.

##### C.1.1 Methodological Overview

The analysis utilizes a custom Python-based geospatial processing framework that handles the computational challenges of analyzing high-resolution (30m) land cover data across large regions, while maintaining fine-scale detail necessary for policy-relevant insights. The processing pipeline includes:

* Polygon-based extraction from continental-scale data  
* Temporal change detection across 39 annual land cover maps  
* Transition matrix calculation for all land cover class combinations  
* Statistical analysis of land cover persistence and change frequency  
* Visualization generation for both spatial patterns and transition flows

We used a desktop computer with 20 cores, 98GB RAM, 8GB CUDA GPU, 3TB SSD and auxiliary external storage. The script runs individual polygons from a geometry collection in a GEOJSON file, and we were able to process up to 800x800 kilometers regions in a single polygon. The batch run of 138 example areas took 70 minutes and topped 8GB memory use on visuals generation.

##### C.1.2 Data Sources and Structure

The implementation works with the following data inputs:

1. Raster Data: MapBiomas Collection 8 (1985-2023) in Virtual Raster (VRT) format  
2. 39 annual layers with 30m resolution in TIFF format  
3. EPSG:4326 coordinate reference system  
4. 35+ land cover classes following the MapBiomas classification system  
5. Vector Data: GeoJSON format, Includes formal boundaries of indigenous territories in Brazil  
6. Properties include official territory name (terrai\_nom) and other attributes

##### C.1.3 Processing Architecture

![][image1]  
The processing is optimized through:

Tile-based parallel processing to enable efficient computation  
Chunked array storage using Zarr for memory efficiency  
Window-aligned reading for optimal I/O performance  
Robust error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms  
In-memory caching of frequently accessed data

#### C.2 Technical Implementation Details {#c.2-technical-implementation-details}

##### C.2.1 Land Cover Change Detection

The change detection algorithm identifies pixels that change land cover class between consecutive years:

def calculate\_changes\_tile(args):

    """Calculate changes for a single tile with robust error handling."""  
    \# Read first year data  
    prev\_data \= robust\_read(src, 1, window)  
    for year\_idx in range(2, src.count \+ 1):

        \# Read current year data  
        current\_data \= robust\_read(src, year\_idx, window)

        \# Identify changed pixels  
        changed \= prev\_data \!= current\_data  
        changes \+= changed.astype('uint8')

        \# Update transition matrix for statistics  
        if np.any(changed):  
            from\_vals \= prev\_data\[changed\]  
            to\_vals \= current\_data\[changed\]  
           
            for from\_val, to\_val in zip(from\_vals, to\_vals):  
                transition\_matrix\[from\_val, to\_val\] \+= 1  
        prev\_data \= current\_data

##### C.2.2 Class Persistence Analysis

The persistence analysis identifies pixels that maintained the same land cover class throughout the entire study period:

def calculate\_class\_persistence(src, window):  
    """Calculate which pixels remained in the same class for all years."""

    \# Read first year as reference  
    reference \= robust\_read(src, 1, window)  
    persistence \= np.ones\_like(reference, dtype=bool)

    \# Compare against all subsequent years  
    for year\_idx in range(2, src.count \+ 1):  
        current \= robust\_read(src, year\_idx, window)  
        persistence &= (reference \== current)

    \# Return both the persistence mask and the reference classes  
    return persistence, reference

##### C.2.3 Geospatial Processing with Indigenous Territory Boundaries

The analysis uses polygon boundaries to clip and analyze only the relevant areas:

\# Transform polygons to pixel coordinates relative to the window  
transform\_window \= src.window\_transform(full\_window)

\# Rasterize polygon boundaries for masking  
mask \= rasterize(  
    all\_polygons,  
    out\_shape=mask\_shape,  
    transform=transform\_window,  
    fill=0,  
    default\_value=1,  
    dtype=np.uint8  
)

\# Apply mask to changes data  
full\_changes\[\~mask\_bool\] \= FILL\_VALUE

#### C.3 Analytical Outputs and Visualizations {#c.3-analytical-outputs-and-visualizations}

##### C.3.1 Land Cover Maps

The framework produces georeferenced land cover maps, compatible with GIS software through world files (PNGW):

def create\_landcover\_map(root, output\_dir):

    """Create land cover visualization with PNGW for GIS compatibility."""  
    \# Create colormap from MAPBIOMAS colors  
    cmap \= ListedColormap(\[COLOR\_MAP.get(i, '\#ffffff') for i in range(max(COLOR\_MAP.keys()) \+ 1)\])

    \# Generate visualization  
    plt.figure(figsize=(12, 20))  
    plt.imshow(last\_year, cmap=cmap, vmin=0, vmax=max(COLOR\_MAP.keys()))

    \# Create PNGW world file for georeferencing  
    pngw\_path \= output\_path \+ 'w'  
    with open(pngw\_path, 'w') as pngw\_file:  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.a}\\n")  \# Pixel size in x-direction  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.b}\\n")  \# Rotation  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.d}\\n")  \# Rotation  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.e}\\n")  \# Pixel size in y-direction  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.c}\\n")  \# X-coordinate of the upper-left  
        pngw\_file.write(f"{transform.f}\\n")  \# Y-coordinate of the upper-left

##### C.3.2 Transition Flow Visualization

The framework generates Sankey diagrams to visualize land cover class transitions during specified time periods:

def create\_sankey(transition\_matrix, classes, title, output\_html, output\_csv):

    """Create a Sankey diagram showing land cover flows between classes."""  
    \# Calculate flow metrics  
    total\_flow \= np.sum(transition\_matrix)  
    out\_flows \= np.sum(transition\_matrix, axis=1)  
    in\_flows \= np.sum(transition\_matrix, axis=0)

    \# Position nodes proportionally to flow magnitude  
    left\_y \= calc\_positions(out\_flows)  
    right\_y \= calc\_positions(in\_flows)

    \# Create interactive Sankey diagram with Plotly  
    fig \= go.Figure(go.Sankey(  
        arrangement="fixed",  
        node=dict(  
            pad=10,  
            thickness=10,  
            line=dict(color="black", width=0.3),  
            label=node\_labels,  
            color=node\_colors,  
            x=node\_x,  
            y=node\_y  
        ),  
        link=dict(  
            source=sources,  
            target=targets,  
            value=values,  
            color=link\_colors  
        )  
    ))

##### C.3.3 Persistence Analytics

The framework quantifies and visualizes the stability of land cover within indigenous territories:

def create\_persistence\_visualization(root, output\_dir):

    """Create stacked bar chart showing persistent vs changed pixels by class."""

    \# Calculate changed counts (initial \- persistent)  
    changed\_counts \= initial\_counts \- persistence\_counts

    \# Create stacked bar chart showing stability by class  
    plt.figure(figsize=(14, 10))  
    bars\_changed \= plt.bar(labels, changed, color=colors, alpha=0.6, label='Changed')  
    bars\_persistent \= plt.bar(labels, persistent, bottom=changed, color=colors, alpha=1.0)

##### C.4 Policy Analysis Integration

This computational framework supports policy analysis in multiple ways:  
Quantitative Impact Assessment: Provides precise measurements of policy impacts on land cover change rates and patterns within indigenous territories

* Temporal Alignment with Policy Implementation: Change analysis can be temporally aligned with specific policy implementation dates  
* Comparative Analysis: Enables comparisons of land cover change between protected and unprotected areas  
* Evidence-Based Evaluation: Generates empirical evidence on effectiveness of conservation and indigenous rights policies  
* Visual Communication: Creates compelling visualizations for policy communication to diverse stakeholders

#### C.5 Technical Limitations {#c.5-technical-limitations}

Several technical considerations should be noted:

Classification Accuracy: Analysis inherits any misclassifications present in the source MapBiomas data  
Temporal Resolution: Annual snapshots may miss seasonal or sub-annual changes  
Spatial Resolution: 30m resolution may not capture fine-scale degradation processes  
Edge Effects: Boundaries between land cover classes may show classification instability  
Processing Requirements: Full analysis requires substantial computational resources (32GB+ RAM recommended)

This appendix documents the technical implementation that underpins the policy analysis presented in the project proposal. The computational framework enables robust, repeatable, and transparent analysis of land cover change in indigenous territories, providing an empirical foundation for policy evaluation. **The appendix MD file was generated with AI support in VS CODE with Github Copilot using the language model GPT-4o.**
