# Appendix A: Case Studies of Indigenous Reserves in Brazilian Tropical Forests

## Overview

This appendix provides detailed case studies examining land cover and use changes in Brazilian tropical forests over the past 50 years, with specific focus on indigenous reserves and environmental conservation units. These case studies complement the main dissertation by illustrating the spatial and temporal relationships between policy implementation and forest conservation outcomes.

## A.2 Case Study Selection Methodology

Eight regions were selected for detailed case studies based on their geographical distribution, historical significance, and representation of different policy implementation timelines. These sites span three major Brazilian biomes and include areas with varying levels of anthropogenic pressure.
